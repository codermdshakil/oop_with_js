// Things that are important for OOP

/**
 * Object is the main thing for OOP but not everything
 * 
 * OOP Four Main Pillar's
 * 1. Abstraction
 * 2. Encapsulation
 * 3. Inheritance
 * 4. Polymorphism
 * 
 *
 * 1. Abstraction - Hide Implementation Details
 * 
 * Example: We use MP3 player but we don't know how it's work behind the screen
 * Example: Math.floor(), Math.ceil(), Math.sqrt(), Math.round(), Math.random(), we use these things but we don't know how it's works behind the screen 
 * Example: var d = new Date()
 * d.getFullYear()
 * d.getMonth()
 * d.getMinutes()
 * d.getTime()
 * we use these things but we don't know how it's works behind the screen 
 * 
 * 2. Encapsulation - All things like Attributes, Methods in a Capsule that means in a Class
 * Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outer access and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class
